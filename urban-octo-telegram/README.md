# Code Refactor Starter Code

#Horiseon Code Refactor

This project was an exercise to refactor a client's website to increase accessiblity for users. I also optimized the css styling by consolidating and organizing selectors to follow semantic structure.

##Lessons Learned

Accessibility for users, such as adding image descriptions, is just as important as any other part of buliding the website
